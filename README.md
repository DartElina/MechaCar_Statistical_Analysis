## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
Our linear regression shows that vehicle length, weight, ground clearance, and spoiler angle all increase miles per gallon. However, having all wheel drive reduces the miles per gallon. I recommend surveying potential customers to learn if they find AWD or fuel efficiency to be more desirable characteristics in their new MechaCar. Since these 2 characteristics have a negative relationship identifying which is more important to our customers means we can maximize customer satisfaction and increase overall sales of the New Product. 


Currently our MechaCar is focused on fuel efficiency. So the control group would not include the AWD. Our null hypothesis would be:

What metric or metrics are you going to test?
What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
What data is needed to run the statistical test?
